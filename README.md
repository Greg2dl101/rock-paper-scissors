# rock-paper-scissors
A simple rock, paper, scissors game that is played solely on the console with
alert messages displayed on the browser. Collectively, this program only took
me a couple hours to complete because of what I've learned in intro to CS at
Uni.

Overall, I was able to work through the logic mostly using things that I head
already learned, but I did learn a bit about JavaScript syntax and how insanely
less troublesome it is compared to programming in C.
